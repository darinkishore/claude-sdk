# Sprint: Project-Level Integration & API Enhancement (S04)

## Sprint Goal
Add project-level abstractions and enhanced session discovery to enable project-based analysis workflows

## Scope & Key Deliverables

### T01_S04: Core Project Model & Path Handling
- Implement `Project` model with session aggregation capabilities
- Add robust path encoding/decoding utilities for Claude Code directory structure
- Create project identification and metadata calculation logic
- Support for project properties: total_cost, tools_used, session counts, date ranges

### T02_S04: Enhanced Discovery & Loading API
- Implement `find_projects()` and `load_project()` functions
- Update `find_sessions()` with optional project filtering
- Add session-to-project back-references
- Update public API exports and maintain clean interface

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
**Core Models (T01):**
- [x] Project model handles directory name encoding/decoding correctly
- [x] Project aggregates session data (costs, tools, dates) accurately
- [x] Path handling works with real Claude Code directory names including edge cases
- [x] Project properties are computed efficiently from session data

**Enhanced API (T02):**
- [x] find_projects() discovers all project directories correctly
- [x] load_project() loads all sessions for a given project by name or path
- [x] find_sessions(project="name") filters sessions by project
- [x] Sessions have .project_name and .project_path properties
- [x] Public API updated with new functions and maintains backward compatibility

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Builds on completed M01 Core Session Parser milestone
- Based on analysis of actual Claude Code directory structure and session patterns
- Focuses on practical project-level analysis workflows for CLI-based usage
- API design prioritizes explicit, non-magical behavior over convenience
- Target completion: 1 week with 2 focused implementation tasks
