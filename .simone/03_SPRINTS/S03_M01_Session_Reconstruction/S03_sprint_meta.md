# Sprint: Session Reconstruction & Metadata Aggregation (S03)

## Sprint Goal
Transform parsed MessageRecord collections into complete ParsedSession objects with conversation threading and metadata

## Scope & Key Deliverables
- Conversation threading reconstruction via parent_uuid relationships
- Session metadata calculation (total cost, token usage, message counts)
- Tool usage extraction and correlation from message content
- ParsedSession container implementation with rich metadata
- Performance optimization for conversation tree construction
- Session validation and integrity checking
- Conversation flow analysis utilities

## Definition of Done (for the Sprint)
- Accurate conversation threading with 100% fidelity to parent_uuid
- Complete session metadata calculation (costs, tokens, tools)
- Tool usage patterns extracted and structured
- ParsedSession provides complete view of session data
- Performance benchmarks for large conversations
- Session integrity validation catches data inconsistencies
- Integration tests with complex multi-branch conversations

## Notes / Retrospective Points
- Depends on S02 JSONL parser being functional
- Conversation threading logic is critical for session understanding
- Metadata aggregation should be extensible for future analytics
