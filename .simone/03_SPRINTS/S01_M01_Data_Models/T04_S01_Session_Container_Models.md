# Task: Session Container Models

## Description
Implement the higher-level container models that aggregate individual MessageRecords into complete session representations with metadata and analysis capabilities.

## Goal / Objectives
Create session-level models for data aggregation and analysis:
- ParsedSession as the main container for complete session data
- SessionMetadata for cost, token, and usage aggregations
- ToolExecution for structured tool usage information
- Support for conversation threading and session analysis
- Enable efficient session data access patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] ParsedSession model containing messages, metadata, and session info
- [ ] SessionMetadata model with cost, token, and tool usage aggregations
- [ ] ToolExecution model for extracted tool usage information
- [ ] Proper typing for all aggregation fields (costs, counts, durations)
- [ ] Support for tool usage pattern analysis
- [ ] Session validation methods for data integrity
- [ ] Full basedpyright compliance
- [ ] Unit tests for all session container models

## Subtasks
- [ ] Create SessionMetadata model with aggregation fields
- [ ] Add total_cost, total_messages, tool_usage_count fields
- [ ] Create ToolExecution model for tool usage tracking
- [ ] Implement ParsedSession as main session container
- [ ] Add session_id, messages list, and metadata fields
- [ ] Include conversation_tree placeholder for future threading
- [ ] Add session validation methods
- [ ] Implement proper field types for aggregations (Dict[str, int] for tool counts)
- [ ] Create unit tests for session data aggregation
- [ ] Test model integration with MessageRecord lists

## Implementation Guidance
Reference the session model definitions in `docs/PYTHON_CLAUDE_CODE_SDK_SPECIFICATION.md` lines 235-277 for complete structure. Focus on:
- SessionMetadata should aggregate data from MessageRecord lists
- ToolExecution captures tool name, input, output, timing
- ParsedSession ties everything together as the main interface
- Design for future conversation tree and threading features

## Related Documentation
- [Technical Specification](../../../docs/PYTHON_CLAUDE_CODE_SDK_SPECIFICATION.md) - Complete session model definitions
- [PRD Core Session Parser](../../02_REQUIREMENTS/M01_Core_Session_Parser/PRD_Core_Session_Parser.md) - Session container requirements (FR-2.3, FR-2.4, FR-2.5)

## Dependencies
- T03_S01_Message_Record_Model must be completed (requires MessageRecord)
