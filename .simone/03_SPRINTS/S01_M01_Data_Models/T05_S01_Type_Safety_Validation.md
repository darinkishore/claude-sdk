# Task: Type Safety Validation & Testing

## Description
Ensure full type safety compliance and comprehensive testing of all data models. This task validates that the entire model layer meets strict typing requirements and works correctly with real data.

## Goal / Objectives
Achieve complete type safety and testing coverage:
- Full basedpyright strict mode compliance (zero type: ignore)
- Comprehensive unit test coverage for all models
- Property-based testing with hypothesis for edge cases
- Integration testing with real JSONL data samples
- Performance validation for model parsing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] basedpyright runs without errors in strict mode
- [ ] 100% unit test coverage on all model classes
- [ ] Property-based tests for model validation edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests with real (anonymized) JSONL data
- [ ] Error handling tests for malformed data
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for model parsing
- [ ] All models handle validation errors gracefully
- [ ] Complete docstring coverage for public APIs

## Subtasks
- [ ] Run basedpyright on models.py and fix all type issues
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit tests for all enums
- [ ] Add unit tests for all content block models
- [ ] Test MessageRecord with various JSONL examples
- [ ] Test session container models with realistic data
- [ ] Implement hypothesis property-based tests
- [ ] Add error handling tests for invalid data
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks for large message lists
- [ ] Test model serialization and deserialization
- [ ] Validate py.typed marker file is properly configured

## Implementation Guidance
Focus on thorough validation and edge case testing:
- Use hypothesis to generate random but valid model data
- Test with malformed JSONL to ensure graceful error handling
- Benchmark parsing performance with large datasets
- Ensure all validation errors provide clear, helpful messages
- Verify that models work correctly with optional/None fields
